# Aim-Trainer
This Aim Trainer project is a Python-based application utilizing the Pygame library to create an interactive aiming practice game. The game window is set to 800x600 pixels, with a background color of dark blue. Players aim to click on dynamically appearing and growing targets before they shrink and disappear, with each successful hit increasing their score. The game features a top bar displaying the elapsed time, hit rate, total hits, and remaining lives. The game ends when the player misses a target three times, displaying a summary screen with total time, speed, hits, and accuracy. The project is designed to improve user reaction times and aiming accuracy in a fun and engaging manner.
